- I think I want to revisit my tvtropes website at some point; I want to scope it down to cleaning out the data to be case insensitive & make sure all the links are valid, and then make a simple UI that takes in two pieces of media and yields their shared tropes
- i also want to revisit my [interactive fiction](https://interactive-fiction.vercel.app/) project/engine thing, but this time maybe as a fanfiction of the road (cormac mccarthy's post-apocalyptic wasteland novel about a father and a son), from the perspective of the/a boy? something about the difficulty of writing branching fiction in a way that emulates true agency -- leaning into the tendencies of the medium to create a work that is mostly frustrating & wrought with inevitability (as a child of the apocalypse you will die one way or another)
