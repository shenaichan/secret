From T.S. Eliot, "The Metaphysical Poets":

> When a poet’s mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man’s experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary. The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking: in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.

And Celine Nguyen, "[research as leisure activity](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/research-as-leisure-activity)":

> **Research culminates in some output**. Research isn’t just about collecting references and evidence and the ideas of other people. It isn’t even about synthesizing them in an interesting way. Research is about *advancing* new arguments and ideas in some form—typically a conference presentation, paper, book, etc.

Sometimes I feel like the goal of all this... living... is to be deeply attentive, to treat everything as significant, to cultivate some little seed inside you that takes the world and lets it ferment into something new and significant, previously inarticulable. This happens consciously and subconsciously; through deliberate curation and attention and _also_ through soft murmuring processes that overtake your hand and splay something new on the page without forethought. This constant element of surprise, surprising oneself, is precious, and everyone has a unique signature of beauty-making inside them that must constantly be nurtured.
