Iris Murdoch in “The Sublime and the Good” (sourced via [_The Marginalian_](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/08/iris-murdoch-the-sublime-and-the-good/)):

> Art and morals are… one. Their essence is the same. The essence of both of them is love. Love is the perception of individuals. Love is the extremely difficult realisation that something other than oneself is real. Love, and so art and morals, is the discovery of reality.

> The tragic freedom implied by love is this: that we all have an indefinitely extended capacity to imagine the being of others. Tragic, because there is no prefabricated harmony, and others are, to an extent we never cease discovering, different from ourselves… Freedom is exercised in the confrontation by each other, in the context of an infinitely extensible work of imaginative understanding, of two irreducibly dissimilar individuals. Love is the imaginative recognition of, that is respect for, this otherness.

Ava Huang in “[grace](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/grace)”:

> You are alien to me; my friends and family are alien to me; we are not the same. Sometimes we have the same perceptions and even the same conclusions, but our thoughts, reactions, emotions will never completely overlap. There is no such thing as a perfect union. And yet love makes it possible to discern without judgment. I can see what is wrong without loving you any less. Your freedom, a perpetual source of friction, is also a perpetual source of relief. You are different from me: that is what makes it possible for me to love you.

Mary Oliver, “The Whistler”:

<blockquote className="poem">
  All of a sudden she began to whistle. By all of a sudden

I mean that for more than thirty years she had not

whistled. It was thrilling. At first I wondered, who was

in the house, what stranger? I was upstairs reading, and

she was downstairs. As from the throat of a wild and

cheerful bird, not caught but visiting, the sounds war-

bled and slid and doubled back and larked and soared.

<br />

Finally I said, Is that you? Is that you whistling? Yes, she

said. I used to whistle, a long time ago. Now I see I can

still whistle. And cadence after cadence she strolled

through the house, whistling.

<br />

I know her so well, I think. I thought. Elbow and an-

kle. Mood and desire. Anguish and frolic. Anger too.

And the devotions. And for all that, do we even begin

to know each other? Who is this I’ve been living with

for thirty years?

<br />

This clear, dark, lovely whistler?

Is love ever finished? Made as we are with an “indefinitely extended capacity to imagine the being of others”, shall we not spend our days searching for new angles from which to behold our loved ones, seeking an endless cascade of revelations which shock ourselves out of our sense of self? _You are different from me: that is what makes it possible for me to love you._ Love dwells only in the lacunae, the darkness begging for light. By your very nature you cannot be reduced to anything I can fully comprehend, so I am always seeking you, so I am always humbly asking for the truth.
