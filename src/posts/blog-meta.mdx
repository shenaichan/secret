I am finally starting to write something I'm happy about, or at least I have an inkling that it will be good. Part of my creative philosphy right now is just reminding myself that basically every individual thing I make or read/see/listen to doesn't actually matter that much, so I should feel a strong sense of liberty in allowing "imperfections". I think this is helping me read more, so maybe it will help me write more.

But I think I'm also just getting better at reading because I'm doing it more. _A_ was saying that actually a large part of enjoying something is literally just being good at it. I didn't like hearing this at first, but I think it's true. Sometimes you just have to get to the point where you're good at something and then it's just exciting generally to do it (even if not every single day). Maybe "being good" at something is an imprecise way to describe the ability to enter a flow state with it. Just being able to relate to a practice in such a way that you are constantly challenging yourself and having a ton of fun rising to those challenges.

Anyway I have been writing on Obsidian lately. It is a lot of fun. I started to go down a styling rabbithole, but then stopped myself. I mostly just changed the font to Lora (which I also use on this blog), and used a community-made color scheme (AnyPpuchin). Writing on Substack made me feel like I had to write a particular way; shaped my thought patterns and prose style. Not necessarily for the worse, but I just felt like I needed a change. I think Obsidian is what I needed in this moment.

The blog post should hopefully be coming out on this site soonish. IDK, maybe a week. I want to set up unique URLs for posts and RSS, which doesn't seem so hard but it is just a nonzero amount of effort. There are also some more little fun things I want to do with this site, like are.na search and block "bookmarking".
