I. 

For a single company I study for months and endure seven hours of interviews just to be rejected. And then I do it again. And again. Each apologetic email, tactfully sent at 4:30 PM on a Friday, knifes the same wound until it is not a wound but a scarred absence, scabbard anticipating occupation. When is the job coming—that once-thought narrative inevitability? I watch my life like a novel I cannot see the back of, thinking surely at 300 pages denouement is close at hand. Then 400, 600, and then a year passes with my wet thumb poised to turn the page, certain now that there is something irretrievably broken, that there is no back cover, no editor to come and slice this story up into something sensible, and I will fall ceaselessly through the pages utterly bewildered, anguished, unfinished. 

II. 

I am in New York and I don't deserve it. I sit for an hour on the A every day, now immune to its groans and odors and heaves, reading McCarthy and Proust, literary fiction and fantasy. Anything, armed with my five library cards, I can get my hands on. Greed and regret. The gnawing hunger of all the time I wasted not reading; the straining ache of staying up until 4 AM devouring page upon page. I love it, or I feel I must do something to defend my intelligence beyond the confines of academia—neither precluding the other.

III. 

I go to an electronic audiovisual show up in Greenpoint, immerse myself in a light-sound bath on the warm, mattress-laden third floor of a nondescript warehouse where they are selling homemade tamales. It is June and everybody knows it; June like a string plucked in the cavity of our chests, resonant from me to you across the room. Most of all I remember watching the artists' hands play over each other, reaching across the synthesizer for various candy-sized buttons and knobs, knuckles flashing indelibly in the neon light. I want to cry at the sheer humanity of it but I am somewhere small inside myself and like the room I am a well incessantly filled with greens and periwinkles. Outside the wail of a police siren. Like John Cage's *4:33* the whine is the music, improvised like the rest of it, life, et cetera. Their hands a poem unto themselves. O how easy it is to love in New York, practically everything bleeding raw and begging for it.

IV.

So I move for the summer in a stroke of stupid, unsustainable genius. Someone asks if I'm from the city; I waffle until my friend finally declares for me: "You live here. You're living here now." I used to be so shrewd and conservative with how I cast my time out into the world, fishing in small, sure ponds. Now I make reckless bets; I eat at my savings without certainty of return, taking loans out against my reputation, my pride. Before my life was a map sprawled endlessly before me, the years like routes marked indisputably for hundreds of miles. Now I have only the compass of my desire. A candle maybe, and a little love to keep me warm. But how far one can stretch a little love.
