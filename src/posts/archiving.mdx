after sitting with my new blog for a few hours i've become very fond of it... i think seeing my work snug against my inspirations is tickling my brain just right.

i think on one hand i am not composed entirely of the media i consume but on the other hand seeing the hundreds of little web/text/img/etc. snippets i've accumulated over the last few months on are.na gives me a lot of joy. feeling myself reaching for a signal processing analogy -- i think if i don't keep an active archive of the things i interact w, the way i conceive of my Self is with a very thin context window, weighting all the things i've experienced very recently the heaviest; everything else gets swept away in the exponentially decaying tail of lost time... all of this is Ã  la recherche du temps perdu..

i feel like i've been trying to extricate the idea of developing a personal archive / record of lived experience / curation of evidence of being alive -- from various pressures by social media giants [to make more and more 6second videos] and ..jobs stuff.. [can my portfolio make me marketable??]. like can i make it so that there is no imperative but beauty ?
