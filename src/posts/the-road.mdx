reading _the road_ and it's so good, un-put-down-able. genuinely so harrowing but also so tender, like that scene where they find the underground shelter... oh my god i was savoring every word. love love love mccarthy... & i want to love faulkner too, maybe _as i lay dying_ is my next next big read. idk maybe there is something to growing up in the south that makes me appreciate southern gothic lit more . maybe i am just grasping at straws though. i want to find a reading/writing community tbh

almost ready to deploy tvenntropes. i got tvenntropes.org for $7.50 which is great, i love cloudflare domains. moved this site over to secret.shenaichan.com. ummmm i want to write a blog post about tvenntropes. i spent a long time scraping the data and i think it's worth a write up but i'm still kind of trying to figure out where to put longform code&wordstuffs. damn maybe i actually do have to revamp my personal website....... she's kind of weird right now . i should probably make it a little more webdevy...? since those are the things that i can write most in depth rn... idk.

will prob try to spend a day working on transcribing a passage of _the road_ into interactive fiction format 2nd person pov of the boy. will be interesting. sometimes i wonder if i'm genuinely into interactive fiction or if i just feel like i'm not good enough at coding or writing for my work in either of those areas to stand alone
