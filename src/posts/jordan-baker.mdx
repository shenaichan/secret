From Joan Didion, in “On Self-Respect”:

> Like Jordan Baker, people with self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things. If they choose to commit adultery, they do not then go running, in an access of bad conscience, to receive absolution from the wronged parties; nor do they complain unduly of the unfairness, the undeserved embarrassment, of being named corespondent.

You say you like cash because you can feel the money leaving you. I am sitting on the subway, panicked because I think I have left my favorite white shirt at your apartment. It’s OK, I rationalize to myself. It was only thirty dollars. When did I decide the only way for pain to occur was in binary: forgiveness on one end, devastation on the other? Sometimes something just hurts thirty dollars—not zero, not a thousand. The bill reluctantly leaving the palm, but leaving it nonetheless, aware of its weight.
