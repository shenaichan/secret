- hello friends i have made a little blog!!
- there are some important things i have yet to do (set up rss & do routing for individual blog posts & make the post loading logic less stupid & move it over to secret.shenaichan.com), but overall i am pretty happy with how it came together in ~2 days
- the major goals were: (1) make it really easy to write n post stuff and (2) xpost my main are.na (inspo) board
- it is probably THE FIRST WEBSITE i've ever made that actually looks good on mobile!! wow!! (my portfolio website is OK, the margins are kind of weird though)
- i started with some lazy figma mocks and then kept iterating on the web directly
- i am happy with the general aesthetic; the grayscale + TNR + tiny margins + general lo-fi-ness is pleasing to me
- i was trying to use lo-fi web tech as well but i relapsed into react lol... it's a vite + react project with handmade css
- and i'm using [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) for the blog content which is certainly overkill but it's nice to have the option to slip into HTML if i want for any given blog post
- css is hard but i'm getting better at it every day!!
