woot woot i feel like i've noticeably gotten better at reading these days; was chatting w some friends at dinner about how i used to think you couldn't get worse at reading, that it was like riding a bike... boy oh boy i was wrong lol. 4 years of engineering school kind of quietly destroyed my ability to read things [at a solid clip, without skipping around or skimming bc my brain is getting antsy, while processing and retaining the deeper implications of the text, &c.].

just today i was reading a wikipedia page and realized i'd gotten through a handful of chunky sections without taking a break, and as i scrolled back up i realized i'd retained a lot of the information. and this year i've finished ~3ish non-YA novels (Brideshead Revisited, All Fours, Lolita) without skimming, which is not as many as I would like (don't ask how many books I've started and not finished this year, lol), but marks a significant shift in my ability to see "serious" texts all the way through to the end, processing every word.

a mindset shift that's been helpful is being honest with myself about my reading ability/background -- perfection is the enemy of great/finished/etc., and especially with something like Lolita which is highly referential and deliberately verbose/opaque ("you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style"), I just tried to accept that I wasn't going to understand it fully on the first go. and that relating to a book doesn't just mean reading it once and getting everything immediately; you can and should cultivate a relationship with a text over time and numerous rereads; reading difficult things right now just gives me a point of comparison to come back to on a reread as a more knowledgeable self. like i can see myself at 27 reading Lolita again and being struck with new insights / appreciating my 22 year old self for laying the amateurish groundwork of initial read

right now i'm reading *Blood Meridian* & i'm about halfway through? i'm also 2/3rds of the way through Slouching Towards Bethlehem... would like to tackle these next. and then after that maybe finishing my reread of The Great Gatsby & starting The Road. rly loving Cormac McCarthy rn, prose goals tbh
